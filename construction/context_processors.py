"""
Shared template context processors (CPMAS-58).

``app_user`` bridges a bit of a real architecture gap: the dashboard
(``apps.core``) authenticates against Django's built-in ``auth.User``
(session login via ``/accounts/login/``), while the domain API
(``users.User`` -- FKs like ``Notification.user``) is a separate model
authenticated via ``/api/auth/login/``. Nothing currently links a
logged-in dashboard session to a specific ``users.User`` row.

Until that's unified (a cross-cutting auth change well beyond this
ticket), this resolves the best available bridge -- a ``users.User``
row whose ``username`` matches the Django session's username -- so
per-user frontend widgets (the notifications bell) have *something* to
scope requests by. When no matching row exists, ``app_user_id`` is
simply empty and those widgets degrade to an empty state rather than
erroring.

Runs on every authenticated template render project-wide (it's a
context processor, not scoped to one app), so the ``users`` table not
existing is treated the same way -- e.g. a test rendering an
authenticated page without ``users.testing.WithUsersTableMixin`` (most
don't, since most pages have nothing to do with this bridge) shouldn't
start failing because of a widget it never asked for.
