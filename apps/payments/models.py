"""
Models for the ``payments`` app -- Accounts Receivable & Accounts
Payable slice (CPMAS-35).

Implements ``Payment``, ``PaymentAllocation``, and ``Receipt``, matching
the ``payments`` / ``payment_allocations`` / ``receipts`` tables in the
approved schema (BRD 5.23 Payments, 5.24 Receipts).

This is the layer that settles both AP (``invoicing.SupplierInvoice``)
and AR (``invoicing.ClientInvoice``) invoices: a single Payment can fund
one or more PaymentAllocations, each applied against exactly one
invoice (either side), and ``payments.services.allocate_payment`` is the
sole place an invoice's status advances to PARTIALLY_PAID/PAID as a
result. "Outstanding balance is calculated from invoice totals minus
payment allocations, not maintained as a manually editable value" (BRD
5.23/5.24) is why neither invoice model stores a balance column --
``payments.services.outstanding_balance`` computes it on read.

Note ``clients.models`` already has managed=False, read-only reflections
of ``payments``/``payment_allocations`` (``ClientPayment``,
``PaymentAllocation``) for the Clients app's own outstanding-balance
summary. Both mappings coexisting is safe: only this app's models are
managed=True and actually own migrations for these tables.
