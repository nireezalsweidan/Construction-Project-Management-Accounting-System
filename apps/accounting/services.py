Business logic for the ``accounting`` app that must not live in a
serializer or viewset.

The single most important rule in this app: BR 12.7 / BRD 5.22 --
"Financial transactions MUST maintain balanced entries (Total Debits =
Total Credits)". Enforced here, not in a serializer, so it can't be
bypassed by any future code path that touches FinancialTransaction.status
