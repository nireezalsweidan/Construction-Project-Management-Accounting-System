"""
Models for the ``accounting`` app -- Accounting / Financial Transactions
slice (CPMAS-34).

Implements ``Account`` (chart of accounts), ``FinancialTransaction``
(journal entry header), and ``TransactionLine`` (journal entry line),
matching the ``accounts`` / ``financial_transactions`` /
``transaction_lines`` tables in the approved schema (BRD 5.22 Accounting
/ Financial Transactions).

Business rule 12.7 ("Financial transactions MUST maintain balanced
entries -- Total Debits = Total Credits") is enforced by
``accounting.services.post_transaction``: a transaction can only move
from DRAFT to POSTED if its lines' debits and credits sum equal. There
is no stored total_debits/total_credits column on FinancialTransaction
-- the schema doesn't define one, and unlike PurchaseOrder/
SupplierInvoice's subtotal/tax/total, nothing else needs to read a
cached balance, so it's simply computed at post time rather than
maintained as a derived field.

This is the first accounting/purchasing/invoicing-family ticket in this
codebase with zero deferred foreign keys: project, client, and supplier
are all real models by this point (CPMAS-47/CPMAS-32-era work), and
Account is defined in this same app.
