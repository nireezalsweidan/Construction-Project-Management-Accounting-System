"""
Test-only utility for the ``employees`` app.

``Employee`` is ``managed = False`` (it reflects an existing Supabase
table owned elsewhere -- see models.py), so Django's normal test-database
setup never creates ``employees``. Any test that needs to persist real
rows must create that table for the duration of the test class -- the
same pattern as ``users.testing.WithUsersTableMixin`` and
``projects.testing.WithProjectsTableMixin``.

``EmployeeProjectAssignment`` maps onto ``project_employees``, which
(since CPMAS-25's migration cleanup) ``projects.ProjectEmployee`` owns as
a real managed table -- its migrations already create it once, up front,
before any test class's setUpClass runs. So this mixin checks for
existence before creating/dropping either of its tables, same as
``WithProjectsTableMixin``.

Tests that also create Project rows should mix ``WithProjectsTableMixin``
(and ``WithClientsTableMixin``, since Project references ``clients`` via
``buyer_id``) in BEFORE this mixin so the ``projects`` / ``clients`` tables
(referenced by the assignment) exist first.
