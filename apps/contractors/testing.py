"""
Test-only utility for the ``contractors`` app.

``Contractor`` and ``ContractorProjectAssignment`` are ``managed = False``
(they reflect existing Supabase tables owned elsewhere -- see models.py),
so Django's normal test-database setup never creates ``contractors`` or
``project_contractors``. Any test that needs to persist real rows must
create those tables for the duration of the test class -- the same
pattern as ``users.testing.WithUsersTableMixin`` and
``projects.testing.WithProjectsTableMixin``.

``ContractorDocument`` maps onto the shared ``documents`` table, which
(since CPMAS-25) the ``documents`` app owns as a real managed table --
its own migrations already create it once, up front, before any test
class's setUpClass runs. So this mixin checks for existence before
creating/dropping any of its three tables, same as
``WithProjectsTableMixin`` -- harmless for the still-genuinely-unmanaged
``contractors``/``project_contractors`` tables (each test class gets and
loses its own), and correct for the now-shared ``documents`` table
(leave it for whoever/whatever created it first).

Tests that also create Project rows should mix ``WithProjectsTableMixin`` in
BEFORE this mixin so the ``projects`` table (referenced by
``ContractorProjectAssignment.project``) exists first.
