Models for the ``notifications`` app -- System Notifications slice
(CPMAS-22, BRD 9: "Alerts for: Overdue invoices, Payment due, Low
inventory, PO/Change order awaiting approval, Budget overruns,
Deadline approaches").

Implements ``Notification``, matching the ``notifications`` table in
the approved schema. Notifications are created by
``notifications.services`` (one function per BRD 9 alert type, run via
the ``generate_notifications`` management command) -- there is no
signal-based auto-generation wired into other apps' write paths, so
adding this app doesn't change any existing app's behavior.
