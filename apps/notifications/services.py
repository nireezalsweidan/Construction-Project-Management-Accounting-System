"""
Alert-generation logic for the ``notifications`` app (CPMAS-22, BRD 9).

One function per BRD 9 alert type, each a plain query over another
app's models that creates ``Notification`` rows for whatever currently
matches. ``generate_all_notifications`` runs all six and is meant to be
invoked periodically -- see the ``generate_notifications`` management
command -- this project has no cron/task-queue infrastructure, so
actually scheduling that call is a deployment decision, not something
wired in here.

Every generator is deduplicating: it won't create a second notification
for the same (user, notification_type, entity_type, entity_id) while an
earlier one is still unread, so re-running this on a schedule doesn't
spam the same still-outstanding condition every time it runs.

Recipients follow the BRD 4.1/4.2 role split: Accountant owns invoices/
payments, Owner owns projects/purchasing/inventory.
