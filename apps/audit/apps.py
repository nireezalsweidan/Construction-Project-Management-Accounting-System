        # Audit scope: users and tax configuration, people records, plus
        # money-moving and counterparty documents. Dropped as low audit value:
        # Project phase, Project budget, Material category, Warehouse, Account,
        # Financial transaction, line items -- high-frequency churn or derived
        # bookkeeping that would flood the trail without helping.
