"""
Business logic for the ``invoicing`` app that must not live in a
serializer or viewset.

Same reasoning as purchasing.services (CPMAS-30): centralizing these
rules in one place makes them structurally enforced rather than just
documented.

1. Monetary totals are always computed here, not accepted as direct API
   input for the invoice header.
2. SupplierInvoice.status/ClientInvoice.status only ever change through
   transition_status/transition_client_invoice_status, validated against
   their respective ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS maps -- except PARTIALLY_PAID/
   PAID/OVERDUE, which are set only by payments.services.allocate_payment
   (CPMAS-35), bypassing these allow-lists entirely (same reasoning as
   purchasing.services._recalculate_po_receipt_status: that's a
   system-derived state change, not a user-facing action to validate
   against a manual workflow).
