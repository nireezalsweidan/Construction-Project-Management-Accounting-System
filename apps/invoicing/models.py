"""
Models for the ``invoicing`` app -- Supplier Invoices slice (CPMAS-32).

Implements ``SupplierInvoice`` and ``SupplierInvoiceItem``, matching the
``supplier_invoices`` / ``supplier_invoice_items`` tables in the approved
schema (BRD 5.16 Supplier Invoices).

Line-item and header monetary totals follow the same derived-value
pattern as ``purchasing.PurchaseOrder``/``PurchaseOrderItem`` (CPMAS-30):
computed by ``invoicing.services``, never accepted as direct API input
for the header. Unlike PO items, ``SupplierInvoiceItem.quantity``/
``unit_price`` are nullable in the schema -- a line can be a flat charge
(e.g. a service fee) with nothing to multiply -- so the derivation rule
is slightly different; see ``invoicing.services.compute_item_amounts``.

``SupplierInvoice.status`` matches the live Postgres enum
``invoice_status_enum`` (DRAFT, SENT, PARTIALLY_PAID, PAID, OVERDUE,
CANCELLED) exactly. Originally (CPMAS-32) only DRAFT/SENT/CANCELLED were
reachable, since PARTIALLY_PAID/PAID/OVERDUE depend on payment
allocations -- the Payments app didn't exist yet. CPMAS-35 (Accounts
Receivable & Accounts Payable) fills that gap: ``payments.services
.allocate_payment`` is now the sole place those three statuses get set,
for both this model and ``ClientInvoice`` below. Same pattern as
CPMAS-30 originally leaving PurchaseOrder.RECEIVED unreachable until
CPMAS-31's goods receiving filled it in.

``ClientInvoice``/``ClientInvoiceItem`` (added in CPMAS-35) are this
app's Accounts Receivable counterpart to SupplierInvoice's Accounts
Payable: an invoice billed TO a client rather than received FROM a
supplier. They match the ``client_invoices``/``client_invoice_items``
tables. Note ``clients.models`` already has managed=False, read-only
reflections of these same tables (``ClientInvoiceSummary``,
``ClientPayment`` etc.) -- those were built by a teammate purely so the
Clients app could compute an outstanding-balance summary without owning
the real create/update/status-transition logic, which is this ticket's
job. Both mappings coexisting is safe: only this app's models are
managed=True and actually own migrations for these tables.
